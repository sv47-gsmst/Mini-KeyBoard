# My 9‑Key Macropad  
Done your hackpad? Congrats! This is my submission for a custom 9‑key macropad built using the XIAO RP2040, Cherry‑style switches, and a fully custom PCB + case.

### Inspiration

I wanted to create a macropad that was both functional and clean — something I could use every day for shortcuts, media controls, and quick actions. Designing the PCB, case, and firmware myself made the whole project feel like a complete end‑to‑end build.

### Challenges

This project pushed me in a few areas:

- Getting the PCB routed neatly in KiCad  
- Making sure the XIAO RP2040 pinout matched my switch wiring  
- Learning how to model and align everything in Fusion 360  
- Ensuring the case fit perfectly around the PCB, switches, and USB port  

Even with the challenges, I’m proud of how polished the final macropad turned out.
